        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>

        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
            <br>
            <li>In digital marketing, a landing page is a standalone web page,
                created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign. It’s where a visitor
                “lands” after they click on a link in an email, or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube,
                Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web.</li>

            <li>As you can see, the landing page exists after prospects at the
                top of the funnel click a link in an ad, email, or anywhere else on the web.</li> <br>
                <li>
                It’s where the conversion (like a purchase, signup, or registration) will take place.</li>
                <br>

               <li> In this post we’ll explore the main benefits of landing pages and answer some common questions.
                By the end of this page, hopefully you’ll love landing pages as much as we do.
                While the homepage has dozens of potential distractions—you can basically call ’em “leaks” instead of
                links—the landing page is super focused.
                Having fewer links on your landing page increases conversions, as there are fewer tantalizing clickables
                that’ll carry visitors away from the call
                to action. That’s why expert marketers always use a dedicated landing page as the destination for their
                traffic.</li><br>

                <li>Sure, the homepage looks amazing. It shows off the brand, lets people explore a range of products, and
                offers additional info about the company and its values.
                From here, a visitor can go anywhere—apply for a job, read some press releases, review the terms of
                service, post on the community boards, etc.</li>
